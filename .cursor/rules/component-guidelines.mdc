# Component Guidelines

## Directory Structure

Components are organized in the following directories:
- [components/ui/](mdc:components/ui/) - Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- [components/shared/](mdc:components/shared/) - Shared components used across multiple pages

## Component Configuration

The project uses shadcn/ui components configured in [components.json](mdc:components.json):
- Style: New York
- Base Color: Neutral
- Icon Library: Lucide
- CSS Variables: Enabled

## Best Practices

1. Component Organization:
   - UI components should be atomic and reusable
   - Shared components should be composable from UI components
   - Each component should have its own directory with index.ts export

2. Component Imports:
   - Use aliases defined in [components.json](mdc:components.json):
     - @/components for general components
     - @/components/ui for UI components
     - @/lib for utilities
     - @/hooks for custom hooks
